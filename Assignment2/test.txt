All
live
births
>
or
=
23
weeks
at
the
University
of
Vermont
in
1995
(
n
=
2395
)
were
retrospectively
analyzed
for
delivery
route
,
indication
for
cesarean
,
gestational
age
,
parity
,
and
practice
group
(
to
reflect
risk
status
)

The
total
cesarean
rate
was
14.4
%
(
344
of
2395
)
,
and
the
primary
rate
was
11.4
%
(
244
of
2144
)

Abnormal
presentation
was
the
most
common
indication
(
25.6
%
,
88
of
344
)

The
``
corrected
''
cesarean
rate
(
maternal-fetal
medicine
and
transported
patients
excluded
)
was
12.4
%
(
273
of
2194
)
,
and
the
``
corrected
''
primary
rate
was
9.6
%
(
190
of
1975
)

Furthermore
,
when
all
deliveries
were
analyzed
,
regardless
of
risk
status
but
limited
to
gestational
age
>
or
=
36
weeks
,
the
rates
did
not
change
(
12.6
%
,
280
of
2214
;
primary
9.2
%
,
183
of
1994
)

Arrest
of
dilation
was
the
most
common
indication
in
both
``
corrected
''
subgroups
(
23.4
and
24.6
%
,
respectively
)

Cesarean
rates
at
tertiary
care
hospitals
should
be
compared
with
rates
at
community
hospitals
only
after
correcting
for
dissimilar
patient
groups
or
gestational
age

In
the
third
trimester
,
the
amniotic
fluid
index
(
AFI
)
may
be
affected
by
maternal
fluid
status

As
the
ambient
temperature
increases
,
there
is
an
increase
in
insensible
fluid
loss
and
the
potential
for
dehydration

We
hypothesize
that
as
temperature
increases
there
would
be
a
concomitant
decrease
in
AFI

From
June
11
to
August
16
,
1993
,
during
a
period
of
unusual
high
heat
,
42
women
with
singleton
pregnancies
between
27
and
40
weeks
'
gestation
undergoing
serial
antenatal
testing
had
AFI
determinations
recorded
at
least
weekly

The
daily
high
ambient
temperature
in
our
urban
area
was
subsequently
obtained

A
2-
,
3-
,
and
4-day
mean
temperature
prior
to
the
test
date
was
compared
to
AFI
using
a
Spearman-rank
Correlation

The
daily
high
temperature
ranged
from
71
to
104
degrees
F
and
AFI
values
ranged
from
1.7
to
24.7
cm
during
the
study
period

There
was
a
significant
correlation
between
the
2-
,
3-
,
and
4-day
mean
temperature
and
AFI
,
with
the
4-day
mean
being
the
most
significant
(
r
=
0.31
,
p
&
#
60
;
0.001
)

Fluctuations
in
ambient
temperature
are
inversely
correlated
to
changes
in
AFI

This
relationship
should
be
taken
into
account
when
interpreting
the
AFI
as
a
measure
of
fetal
well-being

This
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
to
reduce
the
rate
of
macrosomic
infants
in
gestational
diabetes
cases
,
good
glycemic
control
should
be
initiated
before
34
completed
gestational
weeks

The
study
population
included
84
women
with
gestational
diabetes
,
ascertained
by
universal
screening
of
all
women
attending
the
antenatal
clinic
of
the
Hadassah
Medical
Center
,
over
a
2-year
period

The
60
women
(
71
%
)
,
who
initiated
treatment
before
34
completed
weeks
,
composed
the
``
early
''
group

The
24
women
(
29
%
)
,
who
initiated
treatment
after
the
34th
week
,
composed
the
``
late
''
group

All
patients
were
managed
by
an
intensified
protocol
,
including
stringent
glycemic
control
