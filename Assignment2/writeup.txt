Used sklearn-crfsuite to lear a crf model. 
Code inspired from the tutorial at (https://sklearn-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) as reference.

Performed GridSearach to calculate optimum values of parameters of crf model.

Was able to achieve the following cross validation results


Macro_F1 over train: 97.21897496841546
Macro_F1 over test: 71.17697047787296,

only labels [T, D] are considered while calculating Macro F1 Score
